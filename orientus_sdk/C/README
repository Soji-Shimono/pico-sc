Advanced Navigation Packet Protocol Orientus SDK Version 1.1
C Language SDK

******************
**** EXAMPLES ****
******************

Dynamic:
	Uses dynamic memory allocation (malloc) and should be used in most cases.
	The example code connects to Orientus through the serial port and decodes data in real time. Does not work on Mac systems.

Static:
	Does not use dynamic memory allocation and should be used on embedded systems that do not have dynamic memory allocation available.
	The example code decodes a data dump from Orientus.
